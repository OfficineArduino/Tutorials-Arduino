Esplora Educational Datalogger:

This sketch turns your esplora into a scientific datalogger which allows you to read data from an esplora built
in sensor and store it in a SD card.
You can also show "live data" from the sensor or show a graphic of stored data in SD card.

To use it just upload the sketch in your esplora and wait it to start.
When you turn on the esplora the main menu will appear showing 3 option available:
1.Record Data
2.Display data
3.Graph

"Record data" starts the recording function that reads a value from a sensor every 1 second and stores it to the SD.
You can change the interval between two readings changing the value of STORE_DELAY.
If you want to stop the logging just hold the button 1 until the main menu appairs.
Once you're done you can plug the micro SD in your computer and it will contain a txt file called "data.txt" 
with all the saved data.

!REMEMBER!  when you start a new recording with your esplora, the old "data.txt" file will be erased 
and all old data will be lost.


"Display data" shows the current sensor value on the screen. Just hold button 1 to exit from this mode.

"Graph" mode displays on the LCD the stored data in the SD card. It will auto-fit all the stored data in the lcd,
but keep in mind that if the data exceed 162 points the sketch will show an approximate graphic. You have to press 
button 1 to return to main menu.

The default sensor is the light sensor, but you can change the input sensor by replacing 
in read() function "Esplora.readLightSensor()" with the right sensor function e.g. "Esplora.readTemperature()"
